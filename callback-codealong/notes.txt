==The Stack and the Heap==

//What is the Stack?//

- It is an ordered data structure and keeps track of function invocations.

//How Your Code changes the Stack//

- Whenever you invoke a function, the details of the invocation are
saved to the top of the stack (pushed to the top)
- Whenever a function returns, the information about the invocation
is taken off the top of the stack (popped off of the top).

**Definition**
Stack: An ordered set of stack frames. Most recently invoked function
is on th top of the stack. the bottom of the stack is the first function
invoked. The stack is processed from top to bottom. 

Heap: An area in memory where the data is stored.

// By value or by reference //

The object is ccreated in the heap. obj is a reference to the object.

<script>
    var obj = {
        firstname: "Levi",
        Lastname: "Gonzales"
    };
</script>

New Data is not created when we reference the obj that is already placed in memory.

<script>
    var referenceCopy = obj;
</script>
