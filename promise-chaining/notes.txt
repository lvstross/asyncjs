===== Disadvantages of Nested Callbacks =====

- The code is hard to read
- Logic is difficult to reason about
- The code is not modular

===== Promise chaining Advantages =====
- Allow multiple .then functions to be chained onto a promise without having to 
nest some many callbacks within callbacks. 

===== Promises in Practice =====
It is useful to understand how promies work (resolve, reject),
but in practice you will often use promises that returned to you.
In most Ajax driven code, a promise is returned to you to were you can 
then use .then and .catch to handle your code.
