<h1 align="center">Learning Asyncronous JavaScript</h1>

<p>This repo is more like a code journal. As someone who wants to specialize in RESTful 
webservices and fullstack javascript web development, I'm going into a deeper understanding 
of JavaScript in general as well as it's asyncronous features.</p>
<p>Feel free to poke around as there are a lot of code examples for varying topics. I've also taken 
notes on my of the topics and those are found in the notes.text files.</p>
