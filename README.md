<h1 align="center">Learning Asyncronous JavaScript</h1>

<p>This repo is more like a code journal. As someone who wants to specialize in RESTful 
webservices and fullstack javascript web development, I'm going into a deeper understanding 
of JavaScript in general as well as it's asyncronous features.</p>
<p>Feel free to poke around as there are a lot of code examples for varying topics. I've also taken 
notes on many of the topics and those are found in the notes.text files.</p>

#What will you find in this repo?

<p>This repo is primarily driven by asyncronous topics in javascript, such as the aging XHR object, 
the newer Fetch API as well as two popular ajax libraries; jQuery and Axios. I go over the pros and 
cons of using the new Fetch API over the XHR object for ajax calls as well as the benefits that come with using thrid party libraries instead. 
In some of the exercises are examples on how to make ajax calls with all four of the afore mentioned technologies. Inside is also a small project 
I'm working one. I'm building an trivia game using the <a href="https://opentbd.com">Open Trivia Database</a>. 
There is also a bitcoin app, a random user generator and a couple of other small image changing apps.</p>
