===== AJAX =====

Asynchronous
JavaScript
And
XML

Ajax is an approach to web applications where the page does not have to reload in order
to display new content. Rather, javascript in the background performs an http request to
a server, grabs more data and then appends it to the page. This idea is what lead to what is now known
as SPA's (Single Page Applications) where a website can seemingly have many different pages
but instead of loading differnt .html files for each page, javascript loads different content onto 
one .html file based on events liseners and route perameters. 

Though XML is a lagecy data format in contrast to it's more modern sibling, JSON, 
it still fits best in the name because let's all be honest
about our obsession with clearning products ;) ehem... I mean cool naming of things. 

===== XML and JSON =====

XML example:

<pin>
    <title>Adorable Maine Coon</title>
    <author>Cindy S</author>
    <num-saves>1800</num-saves>
</pin>

JSON example:

'pin': {
    'title': 'Adorable Maine Coon',
    'author': 'Cindy S',
    'num-savees': 1800
}
